## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is D2 Cloud?

D2 Cloud helps you:
- **Define policies** that control who can access what in your applications
- **Manage multiple apps** from a single dashboard
- **Collaborate with your team** on policy development
- **Monitor access patterns** and security events
- **Integrate with your existing systems** via SDKs and APIs

### First Steps

1. **Sign up** with OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)
2. **Create your organization** - you'll automatically become the owner
3. **Choose your subscription plan** based on your needs
4. **Invite team members** to collaborate
5. **Create your first policy** for an application

## üí∞ Subscription Plans & Quotas

### Available Plans

| Feature | Free | Essentials | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|------|------------|-----|------------|
| **Price** | $0/month | $99/month | $250/month | Custom |
| **Published Apps** | 1 | 5 | 25 | 1000 |
| **Draft Policies** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Team Members** | 3 | 10 | 50 | Unlimited |
| **Policy Refresh Rate** | 5 minutes | 1 minute | 30 seconds | 10 seconds |
| **Event Storage** | 7 days | 30 days | 90 days | 1 year |
| **Support** | Community | Email | Priority | Dedicated |

### Understanding Quotas

#### **App Limits**
- **What counts**: Only **published** policies count toward your app limit
- **What doesn't count**: Draft policies are unlimited on all plans
- **Example**: On the Free plan, you can create drafts for 100 different apps, but only publish policies for 1 app

#### **Policy Refresh Rate**
- **What it means**: How often your applications check for policy updates
- **Impact**: Lower refresh rates mean faster response to policy changes
- **Override**: Enterprise customers can set custom refresh rates per application

#### **Event Storage**
- **What it tracks**: Access attempts, policy decisions, security events
- **Retention**: How long we keep your audit logs and analytics data
- **Usage**: Longer retention helps with compliance and security analysis

### Quota Management

When you reach a limit:
- **Apps**: You'll get a clear error message when trying to publish beyond your limit
- **Storage**: Older events are automatically purged based on your plan
- **Team**: Invitation links will be disabled when you reach your member limit

**Upgrading**: You can upgrade your plan anytime - changes take effect immediately.

## üë• User Roles & Permissions

### Role Hierarchy

#### **Owner** üëë
- **One per organization** - cannot be changed via the interface
- **Full control**: All admin privileges plus billing and plan management
- **Account management**: Can delete the organization
- **Automatic assignment**: The first person to create the organization

#### **Admin** üõ°Ô∏è
- **Team management**: Invite users, change roles (except owner)
- **Full policy control**: Create, edit, publish, and revoke policies
- **Token management**: Create and manage API tokens
- **Settings access**: Configure organization settings and integrations

#### **Dev** üíª
- **Policy development**: Create and edit draft policies
- **Publishing**: Publish policies to production
- **Key management**: Upload and manage signing keys
- **Limited access**: Cannot manage users or organization settings

#### **Member** üìñ
- **Read-only access**: View policies and analytics
- **No editing**: Cannot create or modify policies
- **Basic monitoring**: Access to basic usage statistics

### Role Management

**Changing Roles**:
- Admins and owners can promote/demote users
- Cannot assign or remove the owner role
- Role changes take effect immediately

**Best Practices**:
- Give developers `dev` role for day-to-day policy work
- Limit `admin` role to team leads and senior developers
- Use `member` role for stakeholders who need visibility but not editing access

## üìù Policy Management

### What Are Policies?

Policies define **who can do what** in your applications. They consist of:
- **App Name**: Which application this policy applies to
- **Roles**: Different user types (e.g., "user", "admin", "guest")
- **Permissions**: What each role can do (e.g., "read", "write", "delete")

### Policy Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "my-web-app",
    "description": "Main web application policies"
  },
  "policies": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "permissions": ["read", "comment"]
    },
    {
      "role": "admin", 
      "permissions": ["read", "write", "delete", "manage_users"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Policy Lifecycle

#### **1. Draft Phase** ‚úèÔ∏è
- **Unlimited drafts**: Create as many draft policies as needed
- **No impact**: Draft policies don't affect your live applications
- **Collaboration**: Team members can review and edit drafts
- **Validation**: System ensures all required fields are present

#### **2. Publishing** üöÄ
- **Goes live**: Published policies are immediately available to your applications
- **Quota enforcement**: Publishing counts toward your app limit
- **Automatic expiry**: Policies automatically expire and refresh every week
- **Version control**: Each publish creates a new version

#### **3. Active Monitoring** üìä
- **Real-time updates**: Applications poll for policy changes
- **Auto-refresh**: Expired policies are automatically extended
- **Event tracking**: All policy decisions are logged for analysis

### Policy Editor Features

**Smart Validation**:
- Real-time validation as you type
- Clear error messages for missing or invalid fields
- Suggestions for common permission patterns

**Version History**:
- See all previous versions of your policies
- Compare changes between versions
- Revert to previous versions if needed

**Collaboration Tools**:
- Comments and annotations on policies
- Review workflows for team approval
- Change notifications via email/Slack

### Required Fields

Every policy must include:
- ‚úÖ **App name** (`metadata.name`) - cannot be empty
- ‚úÖ **At least one role** - each policy needs roles defined
- ‚úÖ **At least one permission per role** - roles must have permissions
- ‚úÖ **Valid JSON structure** - properly formatted policy document

**Server-Managed Fields**:
- **Expiry date**: Always set to 1 week from submission (client values ignored)
- **Version number**: Automatically incremented on each publish
- **Timestamps**: Creation and modification times tracked automatically

## üîë API Tokens

### Token Types

#### **Development Tokens** üõ†Ô∏è
- **Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **Scope**: `dev` - can create drafts and publish policies
- **Usage**: CLI tools, local development environments
- **Security**: Keep secure, rotate regularly

#### **Server Tokens** üñ•Ô∏è
- **Purpose**: Production applications fetching policies
- **Scope**: `server` - can read policies and send events
- **Usage**: Your live applications use these to get policy updates
- **Security**: Tied to specific apps, automatically rotated

#### **Admin Tokens** üëë
- **Purpose**: Administrative automation and integrations
- **Scope**: `admin` - full access to all resources
- **Usage**: CI/CD pipelines, administrative scripts
- **Security**: Highest privilege level, use sparingly

### Token Management

**Creating Tokens**:
1. Go to **API Tokens** section
2. Click **"Create New Token"**
3. Choose token type and scope
4. Assign to specific app (for server tokens)
5. Copy token immediately (shown only once)

**Security Best Practices**:
- Store tokens securely (environment variables, secret managers)
- Rotate tokens regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Use least-privilege principle (don't use admin tokens for server access)
- Monitor token usage in the activity logs

**Token Rotation**:
- Generate new token value while keeping same permissions
- Update your applications with new token
- Old token is immediately revoked

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **"Policy Validation Failed"**
**Cause**: Missing required fields in your policy
**Solution**: 
- Check that `metadata.name` is present and not empty
- Ensure each policy has at least one role
- Verify each role has at least one permission

#### **"Quota Apps Exceeded"**
**Cause**: Trying to publish more apps than your plan allows
**Solution**:
- Upgrade your plan for more apps
- Delete unused published policies
- Use drafts for development (they don't count toward quota)

#### **"Policy Not Found"**
**Cause**: Your application can't find the policy it's looking for
**Solution**:
- Verify the app name matches exactly
- Check that policy is published (not just draft)
- Ensure your server token has correct permissions

#### **"Token Invalid or Expired"**
**Cause**: API token is no longer valid
**Solution**:
- Generate new token in dashboard
- Update your application configuration
- Check token scopes match your usage
